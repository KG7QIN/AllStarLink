.SH "NAME" 
zttest \(em Test if the zaptel timer provides timely response
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.B zttest 
.I [ -v ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.B zttest
zttest runs a timing test in a loop and prints the result of each loop.
The test is as follows:

It reads 8192 bytes from the zaptel timer device (\fI/dev/zap/pseudo\fR). 
This should take exactly 8000 ms . It uses calls to
.I gettimeofday(2) 
before and after that read to check that indeed exactly 8000ms have passed.

Values of 100% and 99.99% Are normally considered a definite 
.I pass.
Values of 99.98% and 99.97% are probably OK as well.
