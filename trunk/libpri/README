Written by Mark Spencer <markster@digium.com>

What is libpri?
===============

libpri is a C implementation of the Primary Rate ISDN specification.  It was
based on the Bellcore specification SR-NWT-002343 for National ISDN.  As of
May 12, 2001, it has been tested work with NI-2, Nortel DMS-100, and 
Lucent 5E Custom protocols on switches from Nortel and Lucent.

What is the license for libpri?
===============================
libpri is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, 
which permit its use and linking with other GPL'd software only.  
The GNU GPL is included in the file LICENSE in this directory.

As a special exception, libpri may also be linked to the OpenH323
library, so long as the entirity of the derivative work (as defined

How do I report bugs or contribute?
===================================
For now, contact the author directly.  In the future if there is 
sufficient interest, we will setup a mailing list.

Does anything use this library so far?
