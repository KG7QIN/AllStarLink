	  information channel selection field in the channel identification
	  IE was displayed incorrectly when using 'pri intense debug'. I

	  everything looked correct until Shaun Ruffell noticed the missing
	  comma in the msg_chan_sel array.

	  libpri.so.1.0, even though the API and ABI have changed over
	  time. This patch changes the Makefile to install the library as
	  libpri.so.1.4 to indicate that this is not compatible with
	  previous versions. In the future, this should be changed as we
	  make ABI changes. (closes issue #10376) Reported by: tzafrir
